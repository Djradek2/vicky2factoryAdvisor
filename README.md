# vicky2factoryAdvisor
Neural network for Victoria 2 that tries to predict which factories will and won't be profitable in your country. Training was quite limited.
You have to put in your Vicky save folder. Supports only vanilla factories. If you don't want to deal with the packages you can download the executable version.
